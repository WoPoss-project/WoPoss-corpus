# The WoPoss modality corpus

The SNSF-funded project _[A world of possibilities. Modal pathways over an extra-long period of time: the diachrony of modality in the Latin language (WoPoss)](https://woposs.unine.ch/)_ aims at reconstructing the evolution of modal meanings from the prehistory of the Latin language up to the 7th century CE. The WoPoss team is working at the linguistic annotation of modal passages based on a selection of modal markers in a diachronic corpus of Latin literary and documentary texts. As annotation progresses, data are made publicly available.

This project has received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF n° 176778 and n° 214102) for the period 2019-2015 and it is hosted at the Institut des sciences du langage (University of Neuchâtel).
